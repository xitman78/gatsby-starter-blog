My today’s English homework was to learn poetry by heart.
And since we had Valentine’s Day recently I’ve learned the following poem by Dan P. Brown.
It was quite a challenge because I haven't been learning by heart any poetry since finishing school in 1995.


### My Promise
####Dan P. Brown

>If you were my rose, then I'd be your sun,<br>
>painting you rainbows when the rains come.<br>
>I'd change my orbit to banish the night,<br>
>as to keep you in my nurturing light.<br>
>
>If you were my world, then I'd be your moon,<br>
>your silent protector, a night-light in the gloom.<br>
>Our fates intertwined, two bodies in motion<br>
>through time and space, our dance of devotion.<br>
>
>If you were my island, then I'd be your sea,<br>
>caressing your shores, soft and gentle I'd be.<br>
>My tidal embrace would leave gifts on your sands,<br>
>but by current and storm, I'd ward your gentle lands.<br>
>
>If you were love's promise, then I would be time,<br>
>your constant companion till stars align.<br>
>And though we are mere mortals, true love is divine,<br>
>and my devotion eternal, to my one valentine.<br>
