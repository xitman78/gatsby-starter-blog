This post is dedicated to a beautiful song written by [Bart Howard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bart_Howard) back in 1954,
that was originally named "In Other Words" and later became known as ["Fly Me To The Moon"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fly_Me_to_the_Moon).

### In Other Words
####Bart Howard

>Poets often use many words<br/>
>To say a simple thing.<br/>
>It takes thought and time and rhyme<br/>
>To make a poem sing.<br/>
>
>
>With music and words I've been playing<br/>
>For you, I have written a song.<br/>
>To be sure that you'll know what I'm saying,<br/>
>I'll translate as I go along...<br/>
>
>
>Fly me to the moon,<br/>
>And let me play among the stars.<br/>
>Let me see what spring is like<br/>
>On Jupiter and Mars.<br/>
>
>
>In other words,<br/>
>Hold my hand.<br/>
>In other words,<br/>
>Darling, kiss me.<br/>
>
>
>Fill my heart with song,<br/>
>And let me sing forever more.<br/>
>You are all I long for,<br/>
>All I worship and adore.<br/>
>
>
>In other words,<br/>
>Please be true.<br/>
>In other words,<br/>
>I love you.<br/>
