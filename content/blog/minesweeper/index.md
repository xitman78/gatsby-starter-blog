Several months ago I developed a web version of classic [minesweeper game](https://xitman78.github.io/react-minesweeper/).
Initially, it was started as a live coding task during an interview.
But then after passing the interview, it became a personal challenge to complete developing
the game so that anyone on the web could enjoy playing my version of the puzzle.
And today, ten months after, I finally managed to publish it using
free [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).

Having that said I proudly present [React Minesweeper](https://xitman78.github.io/react-minesweeper/)

Technology stack: [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/), [Redux](https://redux.js.org/),
[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
